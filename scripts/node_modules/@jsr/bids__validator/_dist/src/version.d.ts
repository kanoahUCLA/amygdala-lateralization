/**
 * Determine the version of the currently running script.
 *
 * The version is determined by the following rules:
 *
 * 1. Search for a hard-coded version populated by git-archive or the build.
 * 2. If the script is running from a local file, the version is determined by
 *    the output of `git describe --tags --always` in the script's directory.
 * 3. Fall back to the static metadata in `deno.json`, which should correspond
 *    to the most recent dev tag.
 *
 * @returns The version of the script.
